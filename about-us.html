</center>
<center>
  <p id="gp">Hi! My name is Grace Schober, a senior at Trumbull High. I love to fill my spare time by contributing to my community through volunteering with the Bridgeport Mobile Food Pantry and Special Olympics. I am also a part of the Interact Club and Red Cross Club. As a fellow high school student, I can, without a doubt, understand the pressure to build up my resume so that it looks the most appealing to colleges and future employers. I only wish I had someone that could help. At KonnectinG, Kaya and I are that someone.</p>

  <p id="kp">Hi! My name is Kaya Patel and I am a senior at Trumbull High. In college I hope to pursue a STEM career and become a cardiothoracic surgeon. In my spare time, I enjoy volunteering, traveling, solving rubikâ€™s cubes, and listening to Taylor Swift. At school, I am involved in a variety of clubs such as the Interact Club and Latin Club, and even the Geography Club where I helped host a competition for middle schoolers through the Geography Club. I have been involved in numerous summer programs and internships myself, from the free Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program to the Yale Young Global Scholars in Biostatistics internship. These opportunities have given me great experiences outside of the school environment and I think every student should try to gain these experiences as well. Whether the summer opportunity is big or small, they offer so much in building responsibility and sparking passion in a student, and for this reason we want to help!</p>
